Bugfix with importing JSON data to Signature Request


0.2.3

Changes to SignatureRequest class:
- new properties and setters for them added
	$use_text_tags => (set|get)UseTextTags([true|false])
	$hide_text_tags => (set|get)HideTextTags([true|false])
    $redirect_for_signing_to_url => (set|get)RedirectForSigningToUrl([$url]);
    
- policy of importing properties from API JSON response changed to import whatever comes
in the payload; so, non-existing properties will also be populated.

Curl SAFE_UPLOAD set to false for compatibility with PHP 5.6
